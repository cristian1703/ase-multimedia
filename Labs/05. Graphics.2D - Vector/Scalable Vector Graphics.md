# Scalable Vector Graphics - SVG

## What is it?
**Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)** is an
[XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XML)-based markup language for
describing two-dimensional [vector
graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics). SVG is essentially to
graphics what [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is to
text. SVG is similar to Adobe's proprietary Flash technology, but it is a
text-based open Web standard instead of a closed binary format. It is explicitly
designed to work with other web standards such as
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS),
[DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM), and
[SMIL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/SVG_animation_with_SMIL).
