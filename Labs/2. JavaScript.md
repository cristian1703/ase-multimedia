# JavaScript Language

 JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.

> Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. (JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford)
